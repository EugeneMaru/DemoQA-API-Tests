# DemoQa application project tests

# Goal of the Project

1. Create a framework that can be run through terminal and create a nice HTML report
2. Practice core components of Request an Response in API Testing


# pom.xml file
* Which dependencies we need?
    - RestAssured
    - Cucumber-java
    - Cucumber-junit
    - Object Mapper (Jackson, GSON) Cerelization and Decerelization
    - Selenium, Boni-Garcia (No Need for only API tests, could be useful when we do UI vs API testing)

* Which plugin for to be able to run from terminal our code?
    - Maven surefire plugin

# API Tests:
    * Two important topic to do this type of testing
        - How to send our Request?
            BaseURL + endPoint (path param and/or query param)

# DemoQa application project tests

# Goal of the Project

1. Create a framework that can be run through terminal and create a nice HTML report
2. Practice core components of Request an Response in API Testing


# pom.xml file
* Which dependencies we need?
    - RestAssured
    - Cucumber-java
    - Cucumber-junit
    - Object Mapper (Jackson, GSON) Serialization and De-Serialization
    - Selenium, Boni-Garcia (No Need for only API tests, could be useful when we do UI vs API testing)

* Which plugin for to be able to run from terminal our code?
    - Maven surefire plugin

# API Tests:
    * Two important topic to do this type of testing
        - How to send our Request?
            BaseURL + endPoint (path param and/or query param)
            Headers info, content type, Authorizations
            HTTP Request type: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
            Might have a request body

        - How to read and verify response?
            Status code (first thing we need to check)
            Depending on a requirements, we will verify headers and body
            Body verifications: path, jsonpath, POJO, Java Classes, Hemcrest Matches

# De-Serialization: JSON ---> Java Codes (Custom Classes or Collections)
    In order to do it we use as() method which comes from restAssured
    as() ---> method: Object Mappers (Jkson or Json)

## How to run a project
    1. Install Maven locally
    2. Java JDK Installed
    3.Get.exe Installed
    4. Open the folder of the project and start termonal inside that folder
    5. Run command ``mvn clean verify``
